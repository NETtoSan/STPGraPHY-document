_as a consumer_

Install node.js from a website first

And download index.js and all of its important components like `commands` and `system`

These folders are contained files thats coded in Javascript. So you can edit the code whenever you like

Once downloaded the files. Open command prompt and type `cd C:/users/YOUR_USER_NAME/Downloads/THE_GIT_REPOSITORIES`

Then type `node .` In the command prompt

If you haven't done anything wrong. The system should come up with `STPGRaphy bot is online!`

This will automatically connect to my client bot as if you're contributing me to support the time of bot openings.

_as a developer_

Install node.js from a website . And install and IDE program that supports javascript and json

Download this repository

Locate the repo to the IDE program

Locate `index.js` . Thats the heart of this program

The bot token should be `const token = 'THE_NUMBERS';`. Change it to `const token = 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN';`

After changing the bot token. Open terminal

Type node . as if you're the consumer

If you haven't done anything wrong. It should come up with `STPGraphy bot is online!`
