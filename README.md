STPGraphy (STPGraPHY) or Sait Piboonbumpen photography project. Is a school project that gathers every photographers in school up and try to manipulate these works as teamwork.  This project also invents something new for teachers to collaborate with. And teach other students with our inventions.

Currently there are no "inventions" that can be seen, touch, or feel. Because of budget shortage, bad teammates and COVID 19 outbreak

We have a small group among our teammates who are developing a Discord bot and web-based cloud server to have our clients access our schoolwork photos as easy as possible
